 In console/terminal, run command: python -c “import this”; (yes, Python accepts commandline arguments)

·        Grab the text output, and assign it to a string variable, let’s say <text> in a new python script (you can just copy-paste the text manually);

·        Take your personal email as a second string and concatenate it with <text>;

·        Print the count of all symbols in <text>;

·        Print the count all the vowels in <text>;

·        Print each 18th symbol of the string, but do it in case opposite to the original (print A if the letter is a, print a if A etc.) adding the position of that char in the string in format like:

o   18,

o   36E

o   54

o   72I

o   …

 

Try to avoid parenthesis during the printout, like:

o   (18, ,)

o   (36, E)

o   …
